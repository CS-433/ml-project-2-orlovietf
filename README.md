## About

This repository contains the work done for our second [Machine Learning course](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/machine-learning-cs-433/) project, which was completed in conjunction with the [Laboratory for Biomolecular Modelling](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lbm/) under the mentorship of [Lucien Krapp](https://people.epfl.ch/lucien.krapp). The goal of our effort is to use amino acid sequences to predict the melting temperature (Tm) of proteins, which an important characteristic that indicates a protein's thermal stability.

## Data

The initial approach was to use the [train data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/data?select=train.csv) publicly available for Kaggle's competition [Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction/data). There were updates on this file made by the competition organizers and the final train file used is train_updated.csv.
